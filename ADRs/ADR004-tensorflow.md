# ADR 004: Use of Tensorflow as the machine learning library
## Context
The use of TensorFlow for developing a predictive model for cardiac risk assessment is being considered. TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning framework that can be used to build and train machine learning models, including those for medical risk prediction.
## Decision
We have decided to use TensorFlow to develop the predictive model for cardiac risk assessment.
## Rationale
TensorFlow offers a robust set of tools for building and training machine learning models, including neural networks, which are well-suited for tasks such as medical risk prediction. Its flexibility, scalability, and extensive community support make it a suitable choice for developing a predictive model for cardiac risk assessment.
## Status
Accepted
## Consequences
By using TensorFlow, we can benefit from its extensive documentation, a wide range of available resources, and the ability to leverage pre-trained models and transfer learning techniques. However, it is important to ensure that the model is developed and validated in compliance with the best practices to guarantee its effectiveness.
## Conclusion
The decision to use TensorFlow for developing the predictive model for cardiac risk assessment is based on its suitability for building and training machine learning models. This choice aligns with the goal of leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately predict cardiac risk based on patient information.
